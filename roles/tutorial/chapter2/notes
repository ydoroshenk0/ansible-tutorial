Control Structures are instructions that control the flow of a program.
Conditionals are a type of Control Structure that will apply an action based on a condition.
The two most common Conditionals are IFs and FORs.

IFs verify a fact / run a test and then trigger an action.

# Defining a variable
today: monday

{% if today == "monday" %}
  It's the start of the week!
{% endif %}

If an IF's condition isn't met, the conditional can be redirected into two other paths: else and elif

{% else %} is applied if the IF condition is not met.

{% elif %} is a secondary IF that runs if the first IF failed.

{% if today == "monday" %}
  it's Monday!
{% elif today == "tuesday" %}
  it's Tuesday!
{% elif today == "wednesday" %}
  it's Humpday!
{% else %}
  I lost interest.
{% endif %}

Notes:
 - "monday" vs "Monday" vs monday vs Monday
 
# More vars
today: peanut
monday: peanut
Monday: Peanut

{% if today == monday %} Pass
{% if today == Monday %} Fail
{% if today == "monday" %} Fail
{% if today == "Monday" %} Fail
 
Tests and examples: You can do much more than use the standard - + - < > == != <or>= tests
  - AND / OR {% if month == "january" or "february" and today == "monday" %}
  
  - x in y > If string x is part of string y
  
  {% if "bdr" in inventory_hostname or "sec" in inventory_hostname %}
    This is a core switch
  {% endof %}
  
  - is defined > If there is a variable with this name.
  - is undefined > The opposite.
  
  {% if port_list is defined %}
    This router has NNIs
  {% elif port_list is undefined %}
    This router doesn't have NNIs.
  {% endif %}
  
  - is none > If the variable exists but is empty
  
  {% if ntp_server is none %}
    Looks like someone forgot to update group_vars
  {% endif %}
  
  - not > Used to reverse a test
  
  {% if ntp_server is not none or "core" not in inventory_hostname %}
    This is a weird kind of condition but it illustrates my point.
  {% endif %}
  
  There are many more tests, these were just a few common examples.
